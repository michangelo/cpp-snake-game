- Move your snake with the arrow keys on the keyboard

## SFL Game Development

SFML (Simple Fast Multimedia Library) is used to display graphics. It is a simple to use library that provides a simple interface to the various components of your PC, to ease the development of games and multimedia applications.

- **[how to install the library from their website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/)** 

- [Download SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.0/)

- [SFML Documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.0/)

### Example

Here is the sample program that SFML provides in their tutorials to test if everything is working. You should see a green circle if it works.

```c++
#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>

int main()
{
    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(200, 200), "SFML works!");
    sf::CircleShape shape(100.f);
    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Green);

    while (window.isOpen())
    {
        sf::Event event;
        while (window.pollEvent(event))
        {
            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
                window.close();
        }

        window.clear();
        window.draw(shape);
        window.display();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### WSL/Linux

If you develop C++ on WSL/Linux you may want to create a makefile to help build your project more easily.

```makefile
build: snake.cpp
	g++ -c snake.cpp
	g++ snake.o -o snake-game -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

Also if you use WSL, ensure you've [updated to WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#upgrade-version-from-wsl-1-to-wsl-2), install [VcXsrv and X11](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/),
and set these environment variables in linux:

```bash
$ export DISPLAY=:0
$ export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=0
```

## Debugging

1. Error free compilation and basic window display without error‚úÖ
2. Snake moves clearly in one direction and length stays constant until food is consumed‚úÖ
3. Snake responds intuitively to arrow keys or WASD‚úÖ
4. Food and snake are clearly indicated by color/design choices‚úÖ
5. Food is placed randomly at the beginning of the game and after each time it is eaten‚úÖ
6. Each food eaten grows the snake uniformly‚úÖ
7. Snake eating itself ends/restarts the game‚úÖ
8. Snake eating wall ends/restarts the game‚úÖ
9. The game is reasonably difficult showing consideration of game scale and FPS‚úÖ
10. Overall playability and resemblance of snake‚úÖ
11. Demonstrates OOP concepts by utilizing classes for Snake and Food‚úÖ
12. Code is organized clearly and logically, with meaningful variable names and uniform style‚úÖ
13. Code is documented with clear and meaningful comments‚úÖ
